# MTH4000
This is a module that I am currently taking at Queen Mary University of London as a BSc Mathematics second year student. 

The Module MTH4000: Programming in Python is a module that takes mathematical language and utilises the Python language to help aid in calculations,graphing, writing functions etc. In this module we use Jupyter Notebook to write our code. It gives us a hands on experience on writing and test written code as well as ones we have written ourselves. we write code for various different things such as codes for plotting graphs, defining functions, writing lists etc. many different types of exercise to explore.
